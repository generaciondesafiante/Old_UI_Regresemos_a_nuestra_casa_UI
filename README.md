# ¡REGRESEMOS A NUESTRA CASA! | UI

**Generación desafiante**

_Regresemos a nuestra casa_, it is an international project led by **Generación desafiante**, with which we intend to mark the way back to the place from which we should never have left, the arms of our pastor Jesus Christ, _Yeshua ha Mashiah_ (as originally was named).

## Target

The goal is to show you what has changed our lives: **studying the Bible word for word**, from cover to cover, from the original language, going through history to understand how we got here, what traditions we adopted and from where. Have you ever wondered why you believe what you believe? Well take a minute and think about it.

We will tell you what apps, books and dictionaries you could use to start studying the only words that can transform our lives, the voice that will allow us to find a purpose to wake up every morning. But if you don't have any questions and you got here by chance, no problem! It will also help you learn a little history, certain words in a new language and even "life hacks" for your life. Maybe you realize that the oldest book talks about you or maybe not, who knows? In any case, you lose nothing.

## Be part of us

we're a group of guys who discovered the depth and truth of the best-selling and least understood book in the world, without Bible institutes, large congregations, or religious systems. Without deserving it, we find ourselves within the plan of our God, the Creator of all that exists. We only want to expose the voice of the true and only Shepherd because we know that his sheep will hear his voice.

## Architecture

The front-end framework used in the project is structured as follows:

1. [Design Patterns](#design-patterns)
   - Atomic Design
2. [Technologies](#technologies)
   - Next JS
   - React JS
   - Vercel
3. [Development Tools](#development-tools)
   - Visual Studio Code
   - Git and Github

## Design Patterns

- The project has adopted the Atomic Design pattern in React due to its component management approach, which allows for the proper use of good practices such as SOLID principles.

- The diagram below illustrates the folder structure in the Atomic Design model, which includes subfolders named after the components that fit into each division.

## Technologies

The project uses primarily JavaScript-based technologies and complementary tools.

- React JS: This library will be used to create all our visual components.

- Next JS: It provides integration of React JS with other routing tools, element loading management, and more. For more information, refer to the [Next JS documentation](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app).

- Vercel: It will be the preferred cloud deployment platform for the project.

## Development Tools

- Git and Github: Version control will be managed using Git locally and Github remotely. The following protocol should be followed:

  For this project, **all tasks should be worked on in separate branches cloned from the Develop branch, Once the task is completed, a pull request should be made to merge the feature branch into Develop**.
  Finally, after thorough testing and validation in each demo, the changes can be merged into the main branch (or any other designated production branch).

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
